# Progress bar experiments

A little playground for Code Club on 18 September 2020. Sorry, but I've pulled this together really quickly so things might be a little 'Mac' focussed.

## Getting the code running

This is a simple Node.js app using Express. Ensure Node.js and NPM are installed then: 

* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`

This should open the home page in your default browser. 

## Using VoiceOver for Mac

The real value here comes from experiencing this application as a user of assistive technologies. Here are some commands for VoiceOver (the screen reader that is built into macOS). These are the simplest of commands for VoiceOver but they should suffice for what we'll be doing.

* Toggle VoiceOver on or off with Command + F5
* Move around the page with Control + Option + arrow key
* Click a button with Control + Option + Space
