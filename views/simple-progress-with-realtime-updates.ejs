<p>This example uses the HTML progress element and the ARIA status and alert roles to inform users of commencement, progress and completion </p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is a simple carrot cooking app.
    <button>Start cooking</button>
<p>
    <label for="carrots">Carrot cooking progress <span role="status" id="status"></span></label>
    <progress id="carrots" max="100" value="0">0%</progress>
</p>
<div role="status" id="status"></div>
<div role="alert" id="complete"></div>

<h2>Notes on this approach</h2>
<p>These are some of the things to note from the VoiceOver perspective:</p>
<ul>
    <li>✅ Using the progress HTML element means changes are exposed to the accessibility API for free</li>
    <li>✅ Notifies users of commencement</li>
    <li>✅ Notifies users of progress status (perhaps a bit much? Could be debounced maybe)</li>
    <li>✅ Notifies users of completion</li>
    <li>❓ Would it be better to manage the user focus so that they are moved to an appropriate place after the event</li>
</ul>
