<p>This example uses the HTML progress element only with some focus management. To allow the progress element receive focus programmatically, we have added <code>tabindex=-1</code></p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is a simple carrot cooking app.
    <button>Start cooking</button>
<p>
    <label for="carrots">Carrot cooking progress</label>
    <progress id="carrots" max="100" value="0" tabindex="-1">0%</progress>
</p>

<div id="output"></div>
<h2>Notes on this approach</h2>
<p>These are some of the things to note from the VoiceOver perspective:</p>
<ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Using the progress HTML element means changes are exposed to the accessibility API for free</li>
    <li>‚ùì Focus is moved to the progress element automatically, which:
        <ul>
            <li><em>Might</em> be good in that the user doesn't have to hunt around for where progress is</li>
            <li><em>Might</em> be problematic because we're taking over the user experience</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>‚ùå The changing state of progress is not communicated to the user (although they do have the option of 're-reading' the element with F5 + Control + Option)</li>
    <li>‚ùå The user isn't notified when the 'Your ü•ï is cooked' DOM element is inserted</li>
</ul>
