<p>This example uses the HTML progress element only.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is a simple carrot cooking app.
    <button>Start cooking</button>
<p>
    <label for="carrots">Carrot cooking progress</label>
    <progress id="carrots" max="100" value="0">0%</progress>
</p>

<div id="output"></div>
<h2>Notes on this approach</h2>
<p>These are some of the things to note from the VoiceOver perspective:</p>
<ul>
    <li>âœ… Using the progress HTML element means changes are exposed to the accessibility API for free</li>
    <li>ðŸ›‘ No information is provided to the user once they've clicked the button. They're left to hunt around for the progress element</li>
    <li>ðŸ›‘ The user has to be on the progress element hear changes</li>
    <li>ðŸ›‘ Only the current state is read to the user. If it changes while they're still on it, no notification is provided</li>
    <li>ðŸ›‘ The user isn't notified when the 'Your ðŸ¥• is cooked' DOM element is inserted</li>
</ul>
