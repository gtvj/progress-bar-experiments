<p>This example uses the HTML progress element only.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>This is simple carrot cooking app. Click the button to begin..
    <button>Start cooking</button>
<p>
    <label for="carrots">Carrot cooking progress</label>
    <progress id="carrots" max="100" value="0">0%</progress>
</p>

<div id="output"></div>
<h2>Notes on this approach</h2>
<p>These are some of the things to note from the VoiceOver perspective:</p>
<ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Using the progress HTML element means changes are exposed to the accessibility API for free</li>
    <li>‚ùå No information is provided to the user once they've clicked the button. They're left to hunt around for the progress element</li>
    <li>‚ùå We don't indicate that the task has commenced or that the button is busy</li>
    <li>‚ùå The user has to be focussed on the progress element be notified of changes</li>
    <li>‚ùå If the user finds the progress element, only the current state is announced. If it changes while they're still on it, no notification is provided</li>
    <li>‚ùå The user isn't notified when the 'Your ü•ï is cooked' message is provided</li>
</ul>
